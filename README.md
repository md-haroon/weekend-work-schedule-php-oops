### Weekend Work Schedule Planner

This PHP-based project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to store and manage user schedules for weekend work plans. It allows users to easily input their availability and retrieve their planned schedules based on their current user status and selected dates.

#### Key Features:
- **User Schedule Management**: Users can create and store their weekend work plans.
- **Date Picker**: A built-in date picker feature allows users to select dates and retrieve corresponding schedule information.
- **User-Based Data Retrieval**: The schedule information is retrieved dynamically based on the logged-in user and their selected date.
- **PHP OOP Implementation**: Efficient use of object-oriented PHP for cleaner code structure and future scalability.

This simple project is ideal for managing weekend work schedules and learning more about PHP's OOP capabilities.
